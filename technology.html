                What is artificial intelligence (AI)?
            </h2>
            <p class="content"> <b>Artificial intelligence </b>is the simulation of human intelligence processes by
                machines,
                especially
                computer
                systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech
                recognition
                and machine vision.

                How does AI work?
            </h2>
            <p class="content">As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their
                products and services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is simply one component of AI, such as
                machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training
                machine learning algorithms. No one programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few, including
                Python, R and Java <br>
                <br>

                In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for
                correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this
                way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with people,
                or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions
                of <br>
                <br>
                AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Learning processes.</b> This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules
                for how
                to turn the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing
                devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Reasoning processes. </b> This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing the right algorithm to
                reach a
                desired outcome.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Self-correction processes.</b> This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune
                algorithms
                and ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.
            </p>

        <div class="points">
            <h2 class="headings">
                Why is artificial intelligence important?
            </h2>
            <p class="content"> AI is important because it can give enterprises insights into their operations that they
                may not have been aware of previously and because, in some cases, AI can perform tasks better than
                humans. Particularly when it comes to repetitive, detail-oriented tasks like analyzing large numbers of
                legal documents to ensure relevant fields are filled in properly, AI tools often complete jobs quickly
                and with relatively few errors.
                <br>
                <br>
                This has helped fuel an explosion in efficiency and opened the door to entirely new business
                opportunities for some larger enterprises. Prior to the current wave of AI, it would have been hard to
                imagine using computer software to connect riders to taxis, but today Uber has become one of the largest
                companies in the world by doing just that. It utilizes sophisticated machine learning algorithms to
                predict when people are likely to need rides in certain areas, which helps proactively get drivers on
                the road before they're needed. As another example, Google has become one of the largest players for a
                range of online services by using machine learning to understand how people use their services and then
                improving them. In 2017, the company's CEO, Sundar Pichai, pronounced that Google would operate as an
                "AI first" company.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today's largest and most successful enterprises have used AI to improve their operations and gain
                advantage on their competitors.

                What are the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence?
            </h2>
            <p class="content">Artificial neural networks and deep learning artificial intelligence technologies are
                quickly evolving, primarily because AI processes large amounts of data much faster and makes predictions
                more accurately than humanly possible.
                <br>
                <br>
                While the huge volume of data being created on a daily basis would bury a human researcher, AI
                applications that use machine learning can take that data and quickly turn it into actionable
                information. As of this writing, the primary disadvantage of using AI is that it is expensive to process
                the large amounts of data that AI programming requires.

            <h2 class="headings">Advantages</h2>
